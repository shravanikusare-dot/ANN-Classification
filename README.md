Built and trained an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for binary classification . 
Implemented Dense layers with ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions. 
Used Binary Crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer for model training.
Performed hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance. 
Deployed the trained model using Streamlit for real-time prediction.
